# project3-forum-frontend "Inline-Post"

This is frontend part of my Inline-Post project.

This is car forum project where you can read news, ask for help on the forum page, provide help in (Do It Yourself) section where you can post instruction on how to do specific job related to fixing/improving your vehicle, you can include video and images too.

It also has a Marketplace where user's can list their car for sale and other users can contact them directly.

You can also comment on Forum, DIY and Marketplace section. User's have their own Inbox route where they can find all the messages that were sent to them 
and you can reply directly from there. You can also navigate to other user's profiles to see what they like and if you have something in common.

And same way you can go to your Profile Settings and customize your profile.

Summary:

• Developed using MERN stack

• Created REST API with ability to CRUD models on the frontend

• Designed Authentication middleware using JSON Web Token and bcryptJs to handle passwords

• Used JWT Payload to set up admin role and protect the routes
